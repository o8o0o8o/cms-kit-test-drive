2. 10+ ready to use components with different presets(styles)
3. New Vercel project, deployed and configured with your new Storyblok space
4. Multiple ready pages in different styles

## Demo ðŸ‘€

- [Sanity landing](https://cms-kit-sanity.vercel.app/)
- [Storyblok Landing](https://cms-kit-storyblok.vercel.app/)

## Core Features

- Monorepo using **Turborepo**
- **Multiple CMS** support
- New `/app` dir
- Routing, layouts, nested layouts
- Data fetching, **caching** and **revalidation**
- Server and client components
- Reusable UI components built using **Radix UI**
- Styled using **tailwind CSS**
- Written in **TypeScript**
- Types and components **generation**
- **CLI** to create new set up project
- **Themes** using CSS variables
- **Predefined** structure

## Repo structure

- `apps/storyblok`: CMS app
- `apps/sanity`: CMS app
- `packages/ui`: UI components library, shared between both CMS apps
- `packages/eslint-config`: shared `eslint` configurations
- `packages/ts-config`: shared `ts-config` configuration
- `packages/tailwind-config`: shared `tailwind` configuration

### Types of components

- **UI component** - universal and sharable component between multiple CMSs
- **Controller component** - takes data from CMS, convert it to UI component format, and use UI component with converted props. Each CMS has it's own controller component for each UI component.
- All **controller components** have common propertiers to change style, such as margin, background, alignment etc.

### Components composition and hierarchy

The website structure follows a clear hierarchical composition:

1. Pages

   - Top-level components that represent entire web pages
   - Each page contains multiple sections, SEO properties and theme

2. Sections

   - Container components that organize content into distinct areas
   - Can be configured with settings like margin, background, width, alignment etc.
   - Hold and arrange other components

3. Base Components

   - Components like **link**, **image**, and **rich text**
   - Combination of multiple functional components like **card**
   - Can be combined and reused across different sections

**RichText** component has additional functionality. It allows to add sections inside, which gives ability to combine sections with text.

### New component

1. Create new component using generators

```bash
pnpm gen
```

2. Select type of component to create

```bash
- UI: Create a new UI component
- Storyblok: Create a new content section
- Sanity: Create a new content section
```

3. Enter name of the component
4. Update properties and design
5. Generate types for new properties

```bash
pnpm gen:types
```
